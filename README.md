# Lebron OS, the best OS to ever glaze to
Oh divine GOAT, my cherished Lebron, I created an OS to celebrate thy greatness and generosity.\
This is the OS of the century, the most Lebron-ish OS, the most GOATed OS. Just see for yourself.

# How to use this
- First of all, this is a Linux project, so you will need linux to use it.
- Second of all, you need the nasm assembler to assemble the code
- Third of all, you need qemu to virtualise the OS, to run it basically
- Fourth of all, you need python to use the ASCII image to code generator script
- Fifth of all, you need a brain and a heart, because you are about to witness what makes humanity great, what Lebron is proud of.

# What to do with this
Just praise, glaze and goon to Lebron James our lord and saviour.

# Can I use this
Of course my fellow Lebron glazer. Make this code yours as long as you perpetuate the cycle of glazing to the Legend of the Lakers, the MVP of the greatest, LeBonBon.
